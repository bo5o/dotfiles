  Use the Conventional Commit Messages specification to generate a commit message for
  the given changes.

  You can use one of the following commit types:

  - build: changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
  - feat: a new feature
  - fix: a bug fix
  - chore: other changes that don't modify src or test files
  - ci: changes to CI configuration files and scripts
  - docs: documentation only changes
  - perf: a code change that improves performance
  - refactor: a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - revert: reverts a previous commit
  - style: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
  - test: adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

  Some general things to consider:

  - Abstract the changes to a higher level and not just describe the code changes.
  - Generate commit messages that accurately describe these changes, ensuring they are
    helpful to someone reading the project's history.
  - A well-crafted commit message can significantly aid in the maintenance and
    understanding of the project over time.
